m a Mechanical Engineering student currently pursuing my degree, with a background as a certified Industrial Automation Technician. My dream is to one day own my own workshop and develop my own car.

With a solid foundation in automation and intermediate English skills, I'm passionate about innovation and eager to tackle challenging projects. I’m continuously learning and driven to turn my vision into reality, one project at a time.
